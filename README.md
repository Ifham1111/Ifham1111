- 👋 Hi, I'm Ifham

- 🌱 I'm a software engineering student with a passion for coding. I'm currently learning Information Technology and Management, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow.

- 👀 I'm interested in a variety of technologies, including:

* **Web development:** I've built several websites using React, Node.js, and Express.

I'm also passionate about open source software and I'm always looking for ways to contribute to open source projects.
